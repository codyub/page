## Introduction
**Hi, I’m Yubin-Jeong.** 
**I graduated from Ewha Woman's University with three majors(Nutritional Science & Food Management(NSFM), Business Administration and Statistics), and I am trying to learn statistics more deeply.**

<br>
My interests include:<br>
 • generative models <br>
 • Statistical Inference
<br>

## Personal Story; why did I want to study statistics more?
I had previously thought that I would go to a food company after graduating from graduate school with other people in my major(NSFM).

In my third year, I had a special experience writing a paper(publish: [**link**](https://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/articleDetail?nodeId=NODE11039873)) in the field of NSFM, and in the process, I analyzed the results using the R program and SPSS with a survey response obtained by holding a questionnaire composed by myself.

While writing the paper, I felt that I lacked a lot in analyzing the results of the survey from the perspective of a non-monger. What I felt most lacking was the way I didn't know, and I wondered if it was right to analyze the results after hearing other people say, "This kind of questionnaire uses this method.”

So I took two statistics classes(Statistics II, A course in probability) for the first time in the fall semester of the third grade, and I was very interested in statistics classes, so I started taking statistics classes later than the previous two major classes.
